# News Story Hotline

This project is an automated news service that generates an audio news show based on the stories sent to it. The show is then made available to anyone who calls the phone number and listens to the show, phone service by Twilio.

Other quick facts:
- The stories are fetched from a service called DiggAPI it returns the name of the story, a url to the story, and a list of comments from the post.
- The script for the show should be generated by OpenAI's API for GPT 5. The script is a short and concise list of the stories and the comments in a conversation like format.
- The script should then be sent to ElevenLabs to be read aloud by an AI voice(s). The ElevenLabs API supports multiple voices and languages.
- This project is written in Javascript using the Node.js runtime.
